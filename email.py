# Create a program with a for loop and a break statement. The program should iterate over characters in an email address, exit the loop when it reaches the @ symbol, and print the part before @ on one line. Use the skeleton below:
for ch in "john.smith@pythoninstitute.org":
    if ch == "@":
        break # Line of code.
    print(ch, end="") # Line of code.
